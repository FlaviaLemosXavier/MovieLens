# MovieLens
This is a report designed to present the project development of a movie recommendation system based on the “MovieLens” dataset. The 10 M version of movielens dataset was recommended in the “PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone” by HarvardX course and it is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings.
